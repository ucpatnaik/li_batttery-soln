**Issue Description:**

An easy solution to premature failure of Lithium-Ion Battery using Arduino
Many electronic devices, such as smartwatches, frequently encounter the problem of Lithium-Ion batteries swelling and failing prematurely. This issue has persisted since the initial introduction of these batteries and continues with the latest models even. Although it appears to be a design flaw, it is surprising that how could a global leader like Apple would make such serious mistakes. It could be a defective battery or for some other reason perhaps to limit the usable lifespan of the watch, presumably for techno-commercial reasons, to which this article is made to address.

**Underlying Reasoning**:

Sensitivity of Lithium-Ion Batteries to Over-Temperature
Lithium-Ion batteries are highly sensitive to various factors, with over-temperature being a critical parameter. Monitoring the temperature of each individual battery cell, whether they are single, in series, or in series-parallel configurations, is essential. Ideally, after the battery reaches full charge, the charging current should decrease to zero. Failure to achieve this results in unnecessary current flow, leading to temperature rise, swelling, and eventual failure. In the case of our example smartwatches, the battery swelling causes the display unit to protrude from its chamber. However, when multiple cells are employed in other gadgets, a Battery Management System (BMS) is usually implemented which is beyond the scope of this simple discussion.

**Proposed Solution**:

Current Sensing Circuit with Arduino Simulation
To address this issue, a current sensing circuit is introduced between the charger output and the device being used. This circuit cuts off the output once the battery current reaches a significantly low level. Provided here is an Arduino simulation circuit along with a program code specifically designed for smartwatches, which can be readily utilized. For other devices, suitable modifications in the hardware arrangement and a minor adjustment in the code will resolve the problem.
